# Door Code Collection System

## Project Introduction
The Door Code Collection System is a Java-based application designed to manage and secure access codes for various doors within a facility. This system allows for the efficient organization, retrieval, and validation of door codes, ensuring secure and streamlined access control.

## Features
- **Code Management:** Add, update, and remove access codes for different doors.
- **Secure Storage:** Store all door codes securely with encryption.
- **Access Validation:** Validate access requests against stored codes to grant or deny entry.
- **Audit Trails:** Keep a record of access attempts for security audits.

## How to Run the Program
To run the Door Code Collection System, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [the official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html) or an OpenJDK provider.
2. Download the compiled `.class` files (`DoorCodeCollection.class`, `DoorCodeCollectionImpl.class`, and `Main.class`) to a directory on your computer.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded `.class` files.
4. Run the application by typing `java Main` and pressing Enter.

## Technology Stack
- **Java:** The entire application is developed in Java, making use of its object-oriented features to model the domain and its secure libraries for encryption and data protection.
